                    As everyone knows and loves, <a href="https://playtictactoe.org/" target="_blank">Tic Tac Toe</a> is 
                    traditonally played on paper or even nowadays through the internet. What if I told you 
                    there was a way to combine the in person experience of Tic Tac Toe all while using a computer? 
                    Thats right! Coded by yours truly, I was able to use sparkfun components and arduino code in 
                    order to program in Matlab and C an app which allows you to press physical buttons in order 
                    to display your turns on a computer. Although this assignment was by far the most difficult 
                    I had to complete for my Cornerstone of Engineering class, seeing the result of my work 
                    felt extremely rewarding, pushing me to take a Computer Science course, leading me to 
                    switch my major to Computer Science.
